**Project Description**
Interoperability wrappers for the CorDebug library.

[CorDebug](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms404520%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) is a Microsoft provided API that enables a debugger to debug code that runs in the common language runtime (CLR) environment. It also enables static analysis of crash dumps of processes running the CLR.

The aim of this project is to provide a C# interoperability wrapper around the CorDebug COM API.

**Note:** priority is given to functionality that can be used for static analysis of crash dumps first. Live debugging functionality e.g. steppers, breakpoints etc will follow. For detailed information on available interfaces and functions see the [documentation](https://cordebug.codeplex.com/documentation).
